I am a PhD Student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). At UMD, I am part of [CBCB](https://www.cbcb.umd.edu/) and work with [Dr. Rob Patro](http://www.robpatro.com/redesign/) who leads the awesome [COMBINE-Lab](https://combine-lab.github.io/). My research involves exploring the approaches for quantifying transcriptional uncertainty and creating methods to leverage it for a more informed and accurate downstream analysis. I am in general interested in application and development of statistical and machine learning methods for analysing different high-throughput genomics data. I am also passionate about using data for precision and translational medicine.

Before joining the COMBINE-Lab, I worked with [Dr HÃ©ctor Corrada Bravo](https://www.hcbravo.org/) on using transcriptome segments as base units for quantification and applying them for alternative splicing analysis and clustering on full-length single cell sequencing datasets.

I did my undergrad at IIIT-H in India where I also obtained a MS by Research under [Dr. Vinod PK](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vinod.pk/team.html). I studied the changes in the patterns between different stages of papillary renal cell carcinoma using RNASeq and DNA methylation data. I also examined the relationship between these two modalities and developed integrative machine learning models to predict the stage of cancer.

During the summer of 2017, I also got to work as an intern under [Dr. Simon Anders](https://www.zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de/Anders/default.shtml) at [ZMBH](https://www.zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de), University of Heidelberg. I worked on developing libraries for the visualization of genomics data and on integrating single cell with bulk RNASeq data. I also collaborated with Dr. Sam Corless at [Erhardt Lab](https://www.zmbh.uni-heidelberg.de/Erhardt/) to analyze thousands of ChipSeq datasets in order to find which proteins are enriched at different regions of the genome.
