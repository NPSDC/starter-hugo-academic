I am a PhD Student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). At UMD, I am part of [CBCB](https://www.cbcb.umd.edu/) and work with [Dr. Rob Patro](http://www.robpatro.com/redesign/) who leads the [COMBINE-Lab](https://combine-lab.github.io/). I also collaborate with [Love Lab](https://mikelove.github.io/) at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research interests lie in application and development of algorithms, statistical and machine learning methods for analysing different high-throughput genomics data. I am also passionate about using data for precision and translational medicine.

Before joining the [COMBINE-Lab](https://combine-lab.github.io/), I worked with [Dr HÃ©ctor Corrada Bravo](https://www.hcbravo.org/) on using transcriptome segments as the main inferential unit for analysis and using them for alternative splicing analysis and clustering on full-length single cell sequencing datasets.

I completed my undergraduate studies along with a MS by Research degree under the guidance of [Dr. Vinod PK](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vinod.pk/team.html) at IIIT-Hyderabad in India, where I studied the changes in the expression patterns between different stages of papillary renal cell carcinoma using RNA-Seq and DNA methylation data. I also examined the relationship between these two modalities and developed integrative machine learning models to predict the stage of cancer.
